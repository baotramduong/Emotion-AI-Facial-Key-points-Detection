## Introduction

In this project, we will build, train and test a Convolutional Neural Networks
with Residual Blocks to predict facial key point coordinates from facial images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:

* Tracking faces in images and video
* Analyzing facial expressions
* Detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis
* Biometrics / face recognition
